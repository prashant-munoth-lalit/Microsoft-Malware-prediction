# Microsoft-Malware-prediction
The problem that I am going to solve is to to predict the windows machines that are susceptible to malware attack based on the configurations and other features of the machine.

Performed Data cleaning, cardinality reduction, and Multi-collinearity detection on the data. Developed algorithms models using Logistic regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. 

Tuned them using Bayesian optimization to achieve an AUROC score of 0.63 with Gradient Boosting.
